# IXI modules

**IXI modules extend the basic functionality of the Ict by streaming data from the gossip protocol into custom applications. Because the Ict is a permissionless network, anyone can build IXI modules and share them with others. This reference article contains both the official IXI modules and some that have been built by the community.**

All IXI modules and their configuration files are downloaded into the `/home/ict/modules` directory.

## Official IXI modules

The official IXI modules have been built by the IOTA Foundation.
