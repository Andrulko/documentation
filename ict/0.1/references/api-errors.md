# Troubleshooting

**You may find some of these common issues while sending requests to the ICT REST API.**

## 500 server error

Make sure that the Ict node is online.

Make sure that you use the correct `Content-Type` header and that your data is url encoded in the body of the request.

## 401 Unauthorized request

Make sure that you're using the [correct REST API password](../how-to-guides/interact-with-ict.md).
