## Use Cases

MAM provides secure and trustworthy messaging on a subscription basis.  It underpins messaging through the IOTA Data Marketplace.  In the USA, the University of Southern California (USC) sells local environment data such as temperature and humidity.  IOTA Los Angeles also publishes environment data using a clone of AstroPi from the International Space Station.  There are more data sellers in Europe, Asia, and world-wide.  See the [IOTA Data Marketplace](https://data.iota.org/#/).

MAM is part of [RuuviTag](https://lab.ruuvi.com/iota/), an open source sensor beacon from Ruuvi Labs for creating portable weather stations.

Messages ride on MAM for "over the air software updates" to infotainment and vehicle systems in automobiles.  See the ["Where's my Porsche?"](https://github.com/NelsonPython/MAM/blob/master/knowledgebase/HM.md) demo.  MAM is part of the [Bosch XDK IoT developer kit](https://www.bosch-connectivity.com/newsroom/blog/xdk2mam/) used for secure messaging.    

[Kontakt](https://kontakt.io/blog/iota-will-power-kontakt-ios-location-solution-enable-secure-sale-sharing-telemetry-data/) and IOTA announced plans to incorporate MAM into healthcare and supply chain for sending telemetry to a limited audience.

The [Elaad EV charging station](https://medium.com/@harmvandenbrink/how-elaadnl-built-a-poc-charge-station-running-fully-on-iota-and-iota-only-e16ed4c4d4d5) from the Dutch energy giant Elaad, is a popular MAM use case with IOTA enabled payments for charging your electric vehicle.
