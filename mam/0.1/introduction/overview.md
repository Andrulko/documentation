## Overview

IOTA Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) makes it possible for humans and devices to encrypt entire data streams and securely store them in the IOTA Tangle in a quantum proof fashion. Only authorized parties will be able to read and reconstruct the entire data stream. In essence it works like a radio where only those with the right frequency can listen in.  In MAM only those with the right channel IDs get access to the data.

Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) stands for:

      M asked - the message is encrypted

      A uthenticated - the device sending the message is confirmed

      M essaging - a device may publish a continuous stream of messages to the Tangle

Any person or any device can publish a message at any time.  Messages may be any size.  However, larger messages require more resources to publish and to store.  Messages are encrypted.  Once published, the message cannot be changed.  Subscribers listen to their channel ID to receive their messages.  Only authorized receivers can decipher their messages.
