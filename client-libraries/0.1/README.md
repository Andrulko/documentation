## Client Libraries

Sending and receiving transactions directly through the Tangle using the IRI API requires an in-depth understanding of the IOTA protocol.  To make it easier, several client libraries are available.  JavaScript and C are official libraries supported by the IOTA Foundation.

- [JavaScript](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.lib.js)
- [C](https://github.com/iotaledger/entangled)

These links go directly to github repositories of community supported libraries:

- [JAVA](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.lib.java)
- [C++](https://github.com/thibault-martinez/iota.lib.cpp)
- [Go](https://github.com/iotaledger/giota)
- [PYOTA](pyota/README.md)

#### Useful Tools

- [IOTA Developers Tangle](https://devnet.thetangle.org) for viewing transactions and visualizing the Tangle
- [IOTA API reference guide](https://iota.readme.io/reference) for API details and examples

#### IoT Experiments

- [Smart Charging](https://github.com/iotaledger/high-mobility-blueprints) your electric vehicle (EV) and paying with iota tokens

- [High Mobility-Porsche](https://github.com/iotaledger/documentation-markdown/blob/develop/mam/knowledgebase/HM.md) securely sending data from onboard a Porsche to the Tangle 

- [Smart City - AstroPiOTA](https://github.com/iotaledger/documentation-markdown/blob/develop/mam/knowledgebase/astropi.md) publishing local environment sensor data to the Tangle
