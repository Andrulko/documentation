# Check if a transaction is confirmed

**Value transactions aren't considered final until they're approved by a milestone transaction. When this happens, nodes mark those transactions as confirmed. You can use the IOTA client libraries to check if a transaction has been confirmed.**

Zero-value transactions can still be confirmed, but they don't need to be because they don't transfer value.

If you're unfamiliar with the terms Coordinator, milestone, or confirmation, we recommend that you [read about the Tangle](root://the-tangle/0.1/introduction/overview.md).

This guide uses the `getLatestInclusion()` method in the IOTA core JavaScript client library. This method checks if a transaction is approved by an IRI node's latest solid subtangle milestone.

You could also use the `getInclusionStates()` method to check if a transaction is approved by an array of your own chosen transactions.

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need the following:

* [Node JS (8+)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* A code editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
* Access to a command prompt
* An Internet connection

---

1. Create a new directory called `iota-basics`

2. In the command prompt, change into the `iota-basics` directory, and install the [IOTA Core library](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/tree/next/packages/core)

    ```bash
    cd iota-basics
    npm install --save @iota/core
    ```

3. In the `iota-basics` directory, create a new file called `check-confirmation.js`

4. In the check-confirmation.js file, require the IOTA libraries

    ```js
    const Iota = require('@iota/core');
    ```

5. Create an instance of the IOTA object and use the `provider` field to connect to an IRI node

    ```js
    const iota = Iota.composeAPI({
    provider: 'https://nodes.thetangle.org:443'
    });
    ```

6. Go to [thetangle.org](https://thetangle.org), click **Live** and find a transaction that's in a confirmed state

7. Pass the transaction hash to the `getLatestInclusion()` method to check if the IRI node's latest solid subtangle milestone approves it

    ```js
    iota.getLatestInclusion(['TRANSACTION HASH'])
    .then(states => console.log(states));
    ```

    When you execute the file, you should see an array that contains the `true` boolean, meaning that the transaction is confirmed.

8. Go to [thetangle.org](https://thetangle.org), click **Live** and find a transaction that's in a pending state

9. Pass the transaction hash to the `getLatestInclusion()` method to check if the IRI node's latest solid subtangle milestone approves it

    ```js
    iota.getLatestInclusion(['TRANSACTION HASH'])
    .then(states => console.log(states));
    ```

    When you execute the file, you should see an array that contains the `false` boolean, meaning that the transaction is not yet confirmed.

## Final code

```js
// Require the IOTA libraries
const Iota = require('@iota/core');

// Create a new instance of the IOTA object
// Use the `provider` field to specify which IRI node to connect to
const iota = Iota.composeAPI({
provider: 'https://nodes.thetangle.org:443'
});

iota.getLatestInclusion(['QJYYXR9QQGEQJIIEMYJVVTZODQFXFFZNHHOKMTDBKJ9LLKCYJKSUWBHGHUFCKFQGD9WCXBJ9HRAFZ9999'])
.then(states => console.log(states));
```
