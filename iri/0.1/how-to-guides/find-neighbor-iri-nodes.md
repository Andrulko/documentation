# Find neighbor IRI nodes

**To synchronize their ledgers with the rest of the network, all IRI nodes must communicate with other IRI nodes, which are called neighbors. To find neighbors, you must ask IRI node owners directly.**

1. Go to the #nodesharing channel on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/fNGZXvh)
2. Ask for the URL or IP address of someone's IRI node, and give that person the URL or IP address of your IRI node. We recommend connecting to between 6 and 7 neighbor IRI nodes.
3. Add the URLs or IP addresses of your neighbor IRI nodes to the [`NEIGHBORS`](references/iri-configuration-options.md#neighbors) configuration parameter
