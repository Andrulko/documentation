**Neighbors are IRI nodes that are mutually connected and that communicate directly with each other on the same IOTA network.**

1. Go to the #nodesharing channel on the IOTA Discord.
2. Ask for the URL or IP address of someone's IRI node, and give that person the URL or IP address of your IRI node. We recommend connecting to between 6 and 7 neighbor IRI nodes.
3. Add the URLs or IP addresses of your neighbor IRI nodes to the [`NEIGHBORS` configuration parameter](references/iri-configuration-options.md#neighbors).
