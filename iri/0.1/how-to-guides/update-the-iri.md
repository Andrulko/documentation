# Update the IRI

**The IRI is in a beta development stage, so it's likely to change, meaning that you'll need to update it.**

When a new version of the [IRI is released on GitHub](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/releases), we recommend that you update your local IRI to the new version.

1. Stop the IRI

2. Delete the `mainnetdb` directory, the mainnet.log file, and your current IRI Java file

    :::warning:
    Do **not** delete your `spent-address-db` directory.
    :::

3. Download the latest IRI

4. Run the IRI
