## Seed backup

Trinity takes care of safe seed storage on your mobile device or computer. But you must backup your seed and keep the backup in a safe place.  You will need this backup if you lose your device.

> Be mindful that anyone who knows your seed can spend your funds, even without physical access to your device!

### Three options for backing up your seed

#### 1. Save your seed as a SeedVault file

Exporting your seed to a SeedVault file is recommended.  

SeedVault is a password encrypted file.  SeedVault uses the [kdbx file format](https://keepass.info/help/kb/kdbx_4.html).  This format is also used by the [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) password manager.  You can export and store your seed in SeedVault or the KeePass password manager.  Then, you can import your seed back into the Trinity wallet, when necessary. 

#### 2. Write your seed on a piece of paper

Writing down your seed is another option.  All you need is a pen and paper.  Copy your seed from left to right, top to bottom. **Triple check that your seed is written correctly.**

Make sure to write down your seed's 3 digit checksum separately from your seed to avoid confusion later on.  Remember, your seed backup is human-readable so store it in a safe place.

#### 3. Print your seed

Printing is convenient, but potentially very unsafe.  Proceed with caution if you intend to use a public or Wi-Fi printer.  If your are unsure about security, then use option 1 or 2.

### After backing up your seed, Trinity requires that you re-enter your seed

This step might seem tedious, but it is important to ensure that your backup is accurate.

A checksum is displayed after entering the seed.  If it doesnâ€™t match the checksum you wrote down, then your seed is not entered correctly.

#### Additional security notes:

  1. Do not screenshot your seed
  
  2. Do not print to a digital format and save on your device

  3. Think carefully about where you store your paper seed backup. Anyone who has access to your seed can take your funds.
