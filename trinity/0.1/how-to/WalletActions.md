## Wallet Actions

As of December 2018, Trinity mobile does not support background processes. Anything you do in the wallet – including logging in, sending transactions, and refreshing your balance – require the wallet to be in the foreground.

That means if you navigate to another app while an action is ongoing, that action will **not** be completed.

Future builds of **Trinity mobile** will enable background processes.
