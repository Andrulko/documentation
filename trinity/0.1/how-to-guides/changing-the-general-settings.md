### Connecting to a custom node

Trinity provides a built-in node-balancing service for optimal performance. Every time you open your wallet, Trinity selects a healthy node with a low load.

You may want to select a custom node to connect to. For example, if you run your own IRI node.

To do so, go to **Settings** > **Node**, and enter the URL or IP address of an IRI node.

## Advanced Settings

Advanced users may want to change the advanced settings in certain circumstances.

### Automatic Promotion/Reattachment

To ensure transactions are confirmed on the Tangle, it may be necessary to promote or to reattach. When possible, Trinity will do this automatically.

<i>Advanced users </i> may enable manual promotion/reattachment by turning on Expert mode in Advanced settings. Enabling manual promotion/reattachment will not disable the automatic promotion/reattachment feature.

**Note:** Trinity does not promote/reattach transfers if the application is minimized. Currently automatic promotion/reattachment only takes place when the app is open.
