## Client Libraries

Sending and receiving transactions directly through the Tangle using the IRI API requires an in-depth understanding of the IOTA protocol.  To make it easier, several client libraries are available:  Javascript (Typescript), Java, C, C++, Python, and Go.  Using one of these official libraries is the recommended in order to avoid mistakes and to make it easier to successfully interact with the Tangle.
These client libraries include instructions for the following:

-  getting transactions, ```getTips```, to approve when sending a transaction
-  sending a transaction/bundle to the tangle using ```attachToTangle```
-  fetching transaction data from the tangle in order to ```getBalances```, ```findTransactions``` or ```getTrytes```
-  performing ad hoc queries and analysis
