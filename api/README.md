## Client Libraries

Sending and receiving transactions directly through the Tangle using the IRI API requires an in-depth understanding of the IOTA protocol.  To make it easier, several client libraries are available.  Documentation for JavaScript and PYOTA libraries includes examples and guidance for learners, as well as, experienced developers.

- [JavaScript](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.lib.js)
- [PYOTA](pyota/README.md) (IN PROGRESS)
