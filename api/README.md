## Client Libraries

Sending and receiving transactions directly through the Tangle using the IRI API requires an in-depth understanding of the IOTA protocol.  To make it easier, several client libraries are available:  Javascript (Typescript), C, C++, Java, Go and Python. 
Using one of these up-to-date, official libraries is the recommended in order to avoid mistakes and to make it easier to successfully interact with the Tangle.
These client libraries include instructions for the following:

-  getting transactions, getTips, to approve when sending a transaction
-  sending a transaction/bundle to the tangle using attachToTangle
-  fetching transaction data from the tangle in order to getBalances, findTransactions or getTrytes
-  performing ad hoc queries and analysis

The (IOTA API reference)[https://iota.readme.io/reference] describes all available methods along with examples.
