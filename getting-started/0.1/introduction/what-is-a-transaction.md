# What is a transaction?

**A transaction is an instruction sent by a client to an IRI node to send data or IOTA tokens to an address.**

Transactions can be one of the following types:
* **Zero-value transaction:** Transaction that send only plain text or encrypted data to a recipient's address
* **Value transaction:** Transaction that transfers IOTA tokens to a recipient's address

Value transactions are the only ones that require a signature. Signatures prove ownership of an address that is transferring IOTA tokens.

All transactions in IOTA are free to send.
