# What is a transaction?

**A transaction is an instruction sent by a client to an IRI node.**

Transactions can be one of the following types:
* **Output transaction:** Debits IOTA tokens from an addresses and contains the signature that proves ownership of the address. If the signature is too large, it's fragmented over another zero-value input transaction.
* **Input transaction:** Credits IOTA tokens to a recipient's address or contains no value (a zero-value transaction).

All transactions in IOTA are feeless.
