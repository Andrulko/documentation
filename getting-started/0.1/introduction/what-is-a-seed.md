# What is a seed?

**A seed is a secret password that's used to generate unique addresses and signatures.**

Addresses are the accounts from which [transactions](introduction/what-is-a-transaction.md) are sent and received.

Signatures prove ownership of an address and validate input transactions.

A seed can generate an almost unlimited amount of addresses: Enough that you don't need to worry about ever running out!
