# What is a seed?

**A seed is a secret password that's used to create unique addresses and signatures.**

[Addresses](root://iota-basics/0.1/concepts/addresses-and-signatures.md) are the accounts from which [transactions](../introduction/what-is-a-transaction.md) are sent and received.

Signatures prove ownership of an address and allow IOTA tokens to be spent from addresses.

A seed can be used to create an almost unlimited amount of addresses: Enough that you don't need to worry about ever running out!

Get started and [create your own seed](../tutorials/create-a-seed.md)!
