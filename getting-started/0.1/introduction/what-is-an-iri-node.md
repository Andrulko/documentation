# What is an IRI node?

**An IRI node is a computer that's responsible for validating transactions and storing them.**

To use any IOTA network, you must interact with an IRI node through the API (application programming interface). Many IOTA applications, such as Trinity, use the API behind the scenes to allow users who aren't familar with programming to use IOTA.

IRI nodes can be run by anyone, including individuals, businesses, and the IOTA Foundation. While these groups run IRI nodes, they often don't open them to the public because a high volume of API calls can be costly to the owner.

Therefore, we suggest that you [run your own IRI node](tutorials/run-your-own-iri-node.md) for direct access to an IOTA network.

If you can't run your own IRI node, you can use public ones in Trinity or use websites such as [IOTA Dance](https://iota.dance) to find a list of public IRI nodes.
