# Sending your first transaction with the Trinity wallet

In this tutorial, you'll use the Trinity wallet to send a data transaction on the [IOTA MainNet network](references/iota-networks.md). A data transaction is one that does not transfer value.

**Note:** Sending a value transaction is similar to sending a data transaction, but it requires an address that contains IOTA tokens.

The Trinity wallet is an application that allows you to send and receive transactions.
