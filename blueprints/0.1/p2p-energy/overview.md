# Peer-to-peer energy grid

**Although the supply of energy is often automated, the payment system still requires a high cost to integrate and manual intervention along the way. By creating a peer-to-peer energy grid with IOTA, we can automate the transfer of power and the payment for that power, allowing for more dynamic changes to infrastructure such as distribution and costing.**

The presented PoC demonstrates how the entities of a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy grid can trade energy, by both supplying power and receiving payment for it. The distributed and machine-based nature of the P2P energy grid make this an ideal use case for IOTA. Using IOTA technologies we can develop a solution that creates an infrastructure where even low-powered devices can communicate with the grid in a traceable and immutable fashion.

IOTA is an ideal candidate to implement this PoC because it's feeless, scalable, and designed to work with the M2M economy.

Trading energy on a P2P Energy Grid involves four high-level entities:

**Entity** | **Role**
---|---
Source|Generating electricity such as solar or wind for a producer|
Producer| Managing several sources and receiving payment from the grid
Consumer |Using the power provided by the grid in return for payment|
Grid| Coordinating the distribution of power from the producers to the consumers, and distributing payments|

:::info:
Similar benefits in this PoC can be replicated in any scenario where a resource is distributed to consumers in return for payment, for example for water supply.

* producer - an entity in the PoC that aggregates information from Sources and supplied that information to the Grid
* consumer - an entity that uses power from the Grid and is charged for its use
* grid - the grid processes information from Producers and Consumers to create payment channels
